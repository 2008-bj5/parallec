Parallec Change Log
==========

## Version 0.10.1-beta


_2016-09-30_

* Issue [#24](https://github.com/eBay/parallec/issues/24). Examples are [here](https://github.com/eBay/parallec/blob/master/src/test/java/io/parallec/core/main/http/ParallelClientHttpResponseHeaderTest.java). Save Response Headers into the ResponseOnSingleTask. Note that the key set provided in  esponseHeaderMeta in request can be case insensitive. However in the response headers map returned in the ResponseOnSingleTask, all keys have been lower case for easy access. The key line is as below to enable the save response headers.
* Erased the response headers in the ResponseOnSingleTask if `task.getConfig().isSaveResponseToTask()` is false (default).
* Minor refactored multiple places.

```java
 .saveResponseHeaders(
                        new ResponseHeaderMeta(Arrays.asList("Content-Type",
                                "server", "x-github-request-id"), false))
```                                




## Version 0.10.0


_2016-08-18_

* Added main feature of parallel UDP based on async Netty, with `prepareUdp(String command)` API. Use `setUdpPort()` and `setUdpIdleTimeoutSec()` to set the port and read timeout.  Added tests. 
* In udp/tcp/udp/http/ping/ssh worker, to check context before kill itself, as sometimes the msg is passed faster to the Op Worker which send msg to kill the worker already.  
* Improved test coverage. 

## Version 0.9.4-beta


_2016-07-22_

* Fix Issue [#25](https://github.com/eBay/parallec/issues/25), Enabled different ports replacements with different target hosts. Passed tests. Example check [here](https://github.com/eBay/parallec/issues/25). Key is ` .setHttpPortReplaceable("$PORT")`
* Minor log refinement for ssh sudo user. 

## Version 0.9.3


_2016-06-23_

* SSH: Allow run as super user for ssh: handle SSH commands where password is needed to sudo.  Auto apply the password. Thanks [billzwu](https://github.com/billzwu)
* Test: add coverage: for get target hosts duplicate/empty for CMS.
* Test/Build: update CI setting to enable test on process based Ping. 

## Version 0.9.2


_2015-11-27_

* Build/Maven/Logback: exclude logback.xml in the built jar, thanks to [xmpp](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5178636/xmpp) for raising the [issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33897196/how-to-disable-inherited-logback/33900287#33900287), close [#21](https://github.com/eBay/parallec/issues/21).
* Test: add sleep to make sure server starts first; should fix build issue related to [#7](https://github.com/eBay/parallec/issues/7)
* Test: add coverage: updateRequestByAddingReplaceVarPairNodeSpecific() check null, add some other minor coverage
* Test: fix TcpServerThread (tcp sample server) not closed in test, thus skip idle TCP tests.
